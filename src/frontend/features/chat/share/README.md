# Chat Sharing

The assistant toolbar and user/assistant message context menus open `/chat-share` with the session
and clicked message IDs. The separate page initially selects that message and loads a paginated
history window around it. User and assistant rows show their role, time and up to four lines from a 240-character excerpt, with an
attachment-name fallback. Pending/streaming messages cannot be selected. Whole-row presses select;
scrolling retains ordinary native press cancellation. Excerpts do not render Markdown, media,
tools or reasoning. The exported document still contains the complete selected messages.

The original chat page stays mounted with its unchanged message widths, measured heights, scroll
position and composer draft. It no longer subscribes to sharing selection. The selector's rows are
safe to recycle: each reads its own selected boolean by message ID, while only the bottom controls
subscribe to the count. Individual toggles leave unrelated rows and action consumers stable.
These are source-level guarantees; device rendering/scroll performance is not yet measured.

`ChatShareSelectionProvider` owns IDs for one route identity. Cancel/native Back closes this page;
closing the export preview retains the existing selection, while a closed system share sheet
dismisses both pages to the chat. At most 128 messages can be selected; an empty selection cannot
be confirmed. Leaving the page cancels pending export reads.

Confirmation reads only the selected persisted messages through a single bounded ID query and
restores chronological order, regardless of click order. It does not implicitly include questions
or unselected messages. The conversation may exceed 128 messages. Missing or unfinished content
and failed reads reject the export instead of silently sharing a partial selection.

Two or more selected messages open HTML by default and offer only HTML and Markdown. A single
selected message retains the image default and all three formats. Chat supplies the format policy
with the export request; the preview menu and format changes respect that policy throughout the
request, including when thinking content is toggled.

The source adapter supplies two immutable document snapshots when thinking content exists: omitted
by default, and included when the preview switch is enabled. Thinking covers the visible reasoning,
intermediate prose and readable tool names. Raw tool payloads and diagnostic metadata never enter
the document. The export page receives only a source-owned label and documents; it has no chat reads.

The adapter preserves plain user text and supplies bubble/message presentation hints. HTML uses
the chat hierarchy: right-aligned questions and full-width answers. Framed PNG uses numbered
message sections. Both include the same white Cherry brand signature at the bottom. The conversation
title remains the exported filename and document title without adding an article heading above the exchange.
Markdown ends with a separated brand-name and export-time row using the same signature data.

Process and reasoning keep explicit presentation hints. Their labels reuse the transcript's
`chat.process.duration` and `chat.reasoningStatus.thought` translations, and elapsed time uses the
same approval-wait-aware calculation as the message list. Native previews reuse the CherryUI
disclosures; HTML and PNG start with the same collapsed process summary.

Rendering, temporary files, permanent storage and system delivery remain in the application export
capability. Opening the preview renders the selection's default format without thinking content;
changing the format or switch renders the selected snapshot as needed. Image output is one bounded
file. Image conversion failures prepare HTML; HTML failures retain the complete Markdown preview.
