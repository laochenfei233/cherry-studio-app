# Built-In MCP Plugins

This module owns bundled plugin clients and the connect/disconnect workflow for **Plugins**.
GitHub, Amap, Feishu, DingTalk, Notion and WeCom are implemented. Current behavior is documented in the
[integration reference](../../../../docs/references/agent/built-in-mcp-design.md); proposed designs
are in the [roadmap](../../../../docs/references/agent/built-in-mcp-roadmap.md).

## File Ownership

| Location | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `index.ts` | Public entry point for bootstrap and the MCP runtime |
| `pluginDefinition.ts`, `pluginRegistry.ts` | Plugin registration, catalog projection and admitted tool policy |
| `pluginGuide.ts` | Guide data types, authoring validation and the turn instruction snapshot contract |
| `createPluginsModule.ts` | Connect/disconnect workflow and per-plugin mutation ordering |
| `authorization/` | Method runtimes and observers, native credential storage, and their backend-only contracts |
| `transport/` | Grant-bound clients, fixed-endpoint HTTP and `validatePluginConnection` |
| `plugins/amap/` | Amap definition and workflow guide |
| `plugins/github/` | GitHub definition, workflow guide, OAuth App authorization with PKCE, account identity, token rotation and revocation |
| `plugins/feishu/` | Feishu workflow guide, authorization, shared tool/scope manifest, hosted/local client composition, curated Base/task/calendar operations and tests |
| `plugins/dingtalk/` | Official cloud device authorization, account review, token renewal, behavior authorization and service-bound tools |
| `plugins/wecom/` | Official bot authorization, CLI gateway requests, discovered service schemas, native file transfer and workflow guide |

Keep provider-private code and tests beneath that provider. `authorization` and `transport` are
internal responsibility groups; they do not add public barrels. Each plugin exposes only its
definition through `plugins/<id>/index.ts`.

The [connection page](../../../frontend/features/plugin/detail/connect/PluginConnectScreen.tsx)
selects between `CredentialConnect` and `InteractiveConnect`. `useInteractiveConnect` owns route
observation, browser actions and form state; backend observers own polling and completion.

## Plugin Guides

Bundled providers each own a plain TypeScript guide module at `plugins/<id>/guide.ts` beside
their plugin definition. `PluginDefinition.guide` references its exported
data directly. Each guide contains a positive integer `revision` and ordered `sections`; each section
has a `content` string and a `requiredTools` array of raw MCP names. Template strings can retain
Markdown formatting in the Agent instructions. For example:

```ts
export const feishuGuide = {
  revision: 1,
  sections: [
    { requiredTools: [], content: `Use this plugin for Feishu documents.` },
    {
      requiredTools: ['fetch-doc', 'update-doc'],
      content: `Read the current document before making a targeted update.`,
    },
  ],
} satisfies PluginGuideDefinition;
```

An empty `requiredTools` array supplies common context; other sections require **all** named tools on
the same connection. Registration validates the revision, 1–32 nonempty sections, admitted and unique
prerequisites, and an 8,192-byte UTF-8 limit for the combined trimmed text including section separators.
A missing guide is optional and does not disable tools; invalid guide data is rejected with the other
registration errors. A connection with no eligible sections contributes no guide.

Guides use the ordinary module pipeline without custom loaders, marker parsing, filesystem access or
network reads. Update `revision` with content changes for attribution; it has no cache-invalidation
role. This is bundled instruction data, not an importer or an executable Skill system.

The MCP descriptor carries the bundled plugin id from the stored server record. The Agent tool
resolver selects guides from each connected plugin's executable descriptors after grant and disabled-tool
filtering. Plugin tools and guides are available across Agents without bindings or composer mentions.
Remote names and descriptions cannot identify a plugin.
Each connection produces at most one frozen guide snapshot with `pluginId`, `serverId`, `revision`
and selected text. Connections are ordered by plugin id and server id; sections retain authored order.
Tools from different connections cannot collectively satisfy a workflow's prerequisites.

Keep guides focused on cross-tool workflows and provider-specific pitfalls, not one section per tool.
Tool descriptions and input schemas own parameter formats, pagination and limits; shared prompt rules
own target identification, preserving unrelated fields and uncertain writes. Only add guidance that
helps select or sequence tools beyond those existing descriptions.

Sections retain their own prerequisites so partial grants keep usable workflows. When hosted discovery
fails or one schema is unsupported, surviving tools still select their guides; the Host also retains
the existing discovery warnings for the same turn.

The Host keeps these snapshots in `TurnPlan` beside the executable tools and includes them once in
the application prompt. Pi receives prepared text only. Guides do not change saved Agent instructions,
chat history, persisted inference metadata, permissions, approval or resource grants. Their text is
counted in the existing live context budget; it is not silently truncated. Runtime rules and the user's
request and Agent instructions take precedence over guide workflows. Raw names are discovery hints;
the model must still inspect each tool's current signature before calling its exact catalog alias.

Changes to grants, disabled tools, connection availability or bundled revisions affect the next
prepared turn; existing execution-time revocation checks remain immediate. The plugin catalog also
projects a detached full guide by joining all sections. Guides are consumed by the Agent and are
not displayed on the plugin detail page. Detail pages show two localized prompt examples and a
short usage hint between connection controls and authorization/privacy information. Locale files
own this user-facing copy independently of Agent guide content.

## Workflow And Lifetime

- `pluginRegistry` is the single bundled registration point. Definitions own metadata, reviewed
  tools, read-only validation and an ordered `authMethods` collection. Each method owns its form
  fields and encoder or interactive runtime factory, plus request authorization. Workflows and
  screens dispatch by method capability without provider-name branches.
- `GET /plugin-catalog` returns detached metadata. The connection page defaults to the first listed
  method and offers the others. Manual forms use the method's field rules;
  `InteractiveConnect` renders declared stages, browser confirmation and optional existing-app entry.
  Locale files own all copy under `plugins.catalog.<id>` and `plugins.authorization`.
- `createPluginsModule` coordinates read-only validation, persistence and connection invalidation.
  Mutations serialize per plugin. Each interactive action identifies both plugin and method.
- `PluginAuthorizationManager` creates one runtime and observer per interactive method. Its owner,
  `McpRuntimeService`, stops observers and drains runtimes and native storage work on host disposal.
- `createAuthorizationObserver` schedules polling and completion while a screen observes. It
  reports state, progress and outcomes and leaves retries after failures to explicit user actions.
  Screens subscribe only while focused and active and request a check after browser return.
- `PluginCredentialStore` keeps reusable applications and completed grants in local SecureStore,
  without sync. SQLite owns connection metadata and opaque credential references. See the
  [storage contract](../../../../docs/references/agent/built-in-mcp-design.md#grants-and-connections).
- `PluginCredential` and resolved `PluginGrant` live in `authorization/pluginCredential.ts`.
  `PluginSecretReference` belongs to the database authorization schema. The database service accepts
  `credentialReference`; the native store accepts `credential`. The SQL column remains `credential`.
- `createBuiltInMcpClient` binds the selected method to one grant. `createOfficialMcpClient` uses
  `@ai-sdk/mcp` Streamable HTTP and `expo/fetch`, checks authorization before and after credential
  resolution, enforces fixed endpoints and admitted tools, rejects redirects and never replays
  writes. A rotating credential retains its grant ID; reconnecting replaces that ID.
- GitHub injects a Bearer token and `X-MCP-Tools`; Amap injects a key only into the outgoing URL.
  Their setup checks use `get_me` and Beijing `maps_weather`. Feishu injects `X-Lark-MCP-UAT`
  plus `X-Lark-MCP-Allowed-Tools`; its setup checks account/scope facts and
  at least one permitted tool without a business call. Each method owns credential injection.
- `plugins/feishu/feishuCredentials` owns credential formats and field validation. `feishuOauth`
  implements personal-agent registration, device authorization and user-token renewal through the existing
  HTTP service. `FeishuAuthorizationRuntime` serializes authorization steps, accepts partial tool
  grants with an issued refresh token, and retains application credentials across disconnect.
- `plugins/feishu/feishuTools` derives per-grant discovery policy and the requested scope union from the hosted
  tool metadata and domain declarations. Each local declaration owns input validation and its fixed
  API operation. `createFeishuClient` routes the tool-only client contract to hosted MCP or
  `feishuOpenApi`, which shares credential resolution, rechecks the grant and sanitizes errors.
  Hosted discovery initializes lazily with its own deadline; failure preserves local tools and
  exposes safe discovery warnings. Its OpenAPI requests use the existing HTTP service; closing
  the client cancels local calls.
- Callers share one credential renewal, including its failure. A caller cancels only its wait;
  disconnect, successful replacement and host disposal invalidate the renewal owner. Saving replaces
  the complete native token bundle after checking the grant ID.
- Pending authorization stays in memory. Errors and process interruption require a new flow;
  reusable applications survive. No legacy imports, recovery journals or automatic cleanup retries.

Interactive methods declare `polling` or `callback`. Polling retains the Feishu rules above;
callback methods wait for a system authentication session and an exact redirect. A generic route
adapter removes callback parameters and forwards the original URL to the active method. GitHub
validates the redirect, state, deadline and PKCE proof and consumes each code once. Its `review`
state exposes the account identity and requires explicit confirmation before `ready` can
enter the shared read-only validation and commit sequence. Failed completion requires a new attempt.
Existing-application entry/reset remain optional; native SDK interactions remain future work.

The shared connection hook uses `openAuthSessionAsync` for GitHub's callback flow and
`openBrowserAsync` for Feishu's device flow. GitHub returns through the system authentication
session; Feishu checks the provider's authorization result by polling after browser confirmation.

DingTalk's default `dingtalk_user` method uses the official cloud device flow: retrieve the managed
client ID, open the official confirmation page, poll for an authorization code, exchange it once,
check organization CLI access, then review the account before discovery and commit. Tokens and
optional server-issued application credentials stay in native secure storage. Organization/user IDs
from the token response or optional read-only contact lookup bind reconnects; unknown employee
identity requires disconnect before replacing an existing account.

Its fixed manifest admits selected tools from 14 official services: doc, todo, calendar, contact,
wiki, drive, aitable, sheet, chat, mail, oa, report, minutes and attendance. Discovery uses four
concurrent sessions with per-service deadlines; available cloud tools survive other services'
failures and carry safe warnings.
Raw tool names and write effects remain bound to their reviewed service, never arbitrary endpoints
or remote safety hints. Protocol and tool references are pinned to the
[official DWS source](https://github.com/DingTalk-Real-AI/dingtalk-workspace-cli/tree/8cacb01951d2567b2c0466d14cb6c5c9d0267a68).

PAT (Personal Action Token) challenges are intercepted in JSON HTTP/RPC envelopes and tool results.
Only the provider runtime receives their private fields; the connection page opens the validated
official authorization URL. Scope requests begin a fresh explicit device flow. Approved flows may
exchange new credentials only before account review; no failed tool is replayed. Organization-policy
denials direct users to their administrator. Pending permission flows are memory-only and tied to
the current grant. Disconnect removes local access first and attempts MCP token revocation;
server-issued direct credentials require revocation through DingTalk's authorization management.

GitHub's `github_user` method uses an OAuth App with `repo offline_access` and is available only
with the publisher configuration described in
[GitHub Plugin Authorization](../../../../docs/guides/github-plugin-authorization.md). It stores a
versioned completed object through the shared store; pending codes/verifiers/tokens remain in memory.
The user confirms the account before read-only MCP validation and commit; there are no GitHub App
installation queries or repository-count requirements. Stable numeric account IDs permit
same-account reconnection while preserving Agent bindings.
Changing identity or moving to/from an incomparable personal token requires explicit disconnection.
The shared commit checks the expected previous grant before saving.

`PluginAuthorizationManager.listConnections` adds local, credential-free status to the Data API;
reading the list does not renew tokens or contact a provider. Native-store changes and method status
changes notify connection queries. GitHub distinguishes missing/rejected credentials, uncertain
renewal/storage failures, and resource/network/quota errors. An ambiguous renewal result blocks
further automatic renewal in that runtime until reconnection; there is no durable recovery journal.
A method may capture an optional revocation closure before local disconnect. Local grants and
bindings are removed first, then remote revocation runs with a deadline; failure is reported without
undoing local disconnect. A late HTTP 401 is checked against the exact grant and sent token before
persisting rejection, and never triggers request replay.

A grant change cannot retarget a tool from an already frozen turn catalog. Disconnect disables
existing Agent bindings and revokes the server/grant before best-effort native cleanup.

Every plugin tool keeps `source: 'mcp'`. Disabled tools, approval, deferred discovery,
transcript results, and runtime result limits remain owned by the existing agent/MCP pipeline.
Connecting a plugin makes its permitted tools available to all Agents on each subsequent turn.
Composer references express explicit message intent; legacy Agent plugin bindings do not control
availability. Remote MCP servers retain Agent binding policy. Upstream credentials never grant
tool approval.
Executable catalog descriptions include the saved server name and builtin id so deferred discovery
can find tools by platform names such as `GitHub`, `github`, `高德地图`, and `amap`. Chinese domain
descriptions and character-pair matching also support `飞书日历`. Partial discovery failures reach
the current turn's availability instructions rather than silently disappearing.
Definitions normally admit a fixed tool list. A provider can explicitly accept additional discovered
names through `acceptsDiscoveredTool`; those names always receive `write` policy. Its client must bind
invocation to tools actually discovered on that authorized service. The existing runtime validates
discovered input schemas and applies result-size limits.

## WeCom Official API

WeCom business operations use the current official CLI HTTP gateway under
`https://qyapi.weixin.qq.com/cli`. Cherry implements the protocol in native TypeScript; it does not
bundle a CLI executable. `wecomBotApi.ts` owns confirmation-link creation, polling for bot identity
and the signed `get_cli_config` exchange. Native credentials store bot identity, secret and the
resulting bearer token. The single `wecom_bot` authorization method retains confirmation inside WeCom.

`createWecomClient` queries `/service/discovery` for the catalog and each service schema. It resolves
named request/response references into local `$defs`/`$ref`, preserving recursive document trees and
formula-field definitions without dropping their tools. It resolves nested resources, hides internal
input fields, and qualifies names as `wecom_<service>__<resource>__<method>` (with additional segments when
needed). Only discovered routes can be called. Reviewed service/resource/method names have read
policy; new names receive the existing write approval policy. A reviewed read that acquires upload
or confirmation directives is omitted. Unsupported definitions produce safe warnings alongside
usable tools. Successful discovery is cached for 60 seconds; partial results refresh on the next
request. Schema endpoints must stay under the fixed official HTTPS gateway, without redirects or
credential-bearing query strings.

`wecomApi.ts` uses the shared HTTP client and always POSTs the official stringified `payload`
envelope, including methods whose schema describes a GET. It decodes both gateway and business
errors. Explicit token rejection (`853004`) serializes renewal; a rejected read can replay once,
while a write requires an explicit retry. Network failures and interrupted long writes report an
unknown outcome. Long tasks use the returned task ID through `/task/query` or the original endpoint
with `X-Long-Poll-TaskId` and an empty payload; original write content is not resubmitted for polling.

`wecomFiles.ts` resolves attachment/file-tool `file_entry_id` values through the existing file
service and follows schema references along actual data, including recursive fields, to apply
official file directives to native files. Media uploads replace local paths with media IDs;
octet-stream methods use multipart fields. Uploads are limited to Cherry attachment,
document-export and WeCom-download directories, with a 100 MiB file/multipart limit. Binary/range
downloads are bounded at 64 MiB. File-save fields become actual paths under the app cache, with safe
unique filenames; large JSON results are saved intact instead of being silently truncated. File
directives inside schema unions are omitted as unsupported rather than forwarding unprocessed
paths. The shared runtime continues to validate arguments and apply tool-result limits.

The bundled guide follows current document, table, people, task, calendar, mail, message and file
workflows. Availability and data access still depend on the official service and authorization.
Message-session discovery does not imply unread-message or full chat-history access. Authorization
errors log safe stages and schema locations through `WecomAuthorization`; private values and bot
secrets are excluded from diagnostics.

Regression suites were updated but not run. New authorization, business calls and native file
transfer still require device and live-account acceptance.

## Compatibility And Verification

The initial database schema stores `pluginId` and `authMethod` as open, nonempty durable strings.
Keep IDs stable and version objects inside each method.

The current version supports one connection per bundled provider. Feishu combines nine hosted
document/people tools with nineteen curated wiki, Base, task and calendar operations. Existing
grants retain permitted tools; adding permissions requires reauthorization. See [Feishu Business Tools](../../../../docs/references/agent/built-in-mcp-design.md#feishu-business-tools)
for names, pagination, time/patch semantics and size limits. Feishu attachment transfer is outside
the product scope. Broader API coverage, multiple accounts and other providers' OAuth remain future slices. Write requests
are never replayed; an uncertain write outcome tells the caller to inspect the service before
retrying. All Amap coordinates use GCJ-02 longitude,latitude.

Only bundled registrations can execute. Unknown plugin records remain visible and disconnectable;
unknown auth methods require reconnecting before requests can be sent. The registry is not a
runtime installer and does not load downloaded executable code.
