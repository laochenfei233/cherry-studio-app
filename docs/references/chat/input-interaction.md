# Chat Input Interaction

> Status: scoped interaction contract; native acceptance pending

Keep the existing composer design and motion: the one-row/two-row transition, text growth,
toolbar reveal, add menu, and reasoning panel animations belong to their current components.
A keyboard-stability fix preserves these visuals and changes only the conflicting event path.

## Keyboard And Selection Rules

- Send submits the draft, explicitly blurs the input, ends composer editing, and dismisses the
  keyboard through its native transition. The dock follows the keyboard's actual position on both
  opening and closing; the empty composer's collapse uses the same motion as expansion. List
  scrolling after submission must not issue a second keyboard-dismiss command.
- Scrolling, selecting text, copying, and pressing message actions perform their own operation.
  A parent `onTouchEnd` must not turn all of them into an input-dismiss action. A completed,
  unhandled tap on the chat background explicitly blurs the input and ends composer editing.
  The list lets that press reach the background owner; scrolling can cancel the press.
- Keyboard show/hide notifications describe native state. They do not establish that the user
  ended editing and must not trigger an additional composer blur or layout transition.
- The complete add-menu → plugin picker → select/reselect or cancel flow preserves the keyboard's
  current open/closed state. Insertion uses the editor's retained position without requesting focus.
  Popover accessibility isolation keeps its native ancestor mounted throughout the flow.
- Long press, selection-handle dragging, Select All, Copy, and editing-menu dismissal preserve the
  composer's current presentation and keyboard state. Raw touches on a popover's composer anchor
  must not close the panel while the editor is interpreting that sequence.
- Explicit model, file, camera, and photo selection keep the existing input-transfer behavior.
  Their presentation, draft semantics, and animations are not redesigned by this patch.

## Operation Boundaries

| Operation | Owner and expected effect |
| --- | --- |
| Tap to edit, type, delete, paste, undo, or move the caret | Native editor; retain existing content growth and composer motion |
| Select content, drag handles, copy, or dismiss the editing menu | Native selection; no added focus, blur, panel close, or outer layout change |
| Tap chat background outside the composer | Blur the editor and end editing through the existing composer transition |
| Open/close add or reasoning controls | Existing control and animation; no new global keyboard policy |
| Choose a plugin | Insert once or retain the existing reference; no forced text focus |
| Select a model or choose media/files | Existing picker and input-transfer path |
| Send | Submit the draft, blur the input, end editing, and dismiss the keyboard; local-send scrolling does not dismiss input again |
| Stop | Existing cancellation flow; preserve the input's focus and keyboard state |
| Admission/import failure or approval arrival | Existing recovery, attachment, and approval workflow |
| Scroll or use message content | Message/list owner; no blanket parent touch dismissal |
| Navigate to another context | Existing navigation and draft ownership |

Draft recovery, attachment failure presentation, approval prompts, model persistence, reasoning
value policy, and navigation-wide draft storage retain their existing behavior. They require their
own scoped changes if an observed problem warrants one.

## Acceptance

Source changes remove the identified application commands; they do not establish native keyboard
or selection conformance. With explicit device-verification authorization, check on iOS and Android:

- Original composer and tool animations remain visible, including reduced-motion behavior.
- With the keyboard open and then closed, select text, drag both handles, Select All, Copy, and
  dismiss the editing menu. The selected range may change; the outer composer and keyboard state
  remain stable without a brief hide/show cycle.
- Send a message to blur the input, end editing, and dismiss the keyboard. Scrolling and message
  actions do not issue additional keyboard-dismiss commands.
- Tap the empty chat or unused message-list area to blur the input and dismiss its keyboard.
  An empty composer follows its existing collapse animation; dragging or child actions do not
  count as background presses.
- With the keyboard open and then closed, open the add menu and plugin picker, scroll the plugins,
  select/reselect a plugin, and cancel through the backdrop or Back. The keyboard stays in its
  original state throughout, without a brief hide/show cycle.
- Open/cancel model and media pickers and continue editing through their existing handoff.
